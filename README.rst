pycards
===================

GUI to play your favorite card game. The rules are not coded, but it allows to manipulate a deck of card, shuffle them, discover, destroy or lock single cards. You can import any set of cards.
The idea is to reset a legacy card game, instead of buying a new one and you still keep the legacy part.
